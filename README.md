# DNA-Breathing-Codebase-Sample
## Selection of notebooks and figures from the DNA-Breathing codebase for skill demonstration

PI: Dr. Xin He

### Directories:

Fasta: Notebooks for statistical tests on DNA sequences, most important part of the codebase. The results of these notebooks are being used to write a publication.

Data Processing: Contains notebooks used to edit datasets or generate figures for exploration. Also contains scripts to load datasets for machine learning model training and evaluation.

Eval: Notebooks for evaluating different aspects of machine learning model function.

Model: Different configuration files for PyTorch/Tensorflow machine learning models.
